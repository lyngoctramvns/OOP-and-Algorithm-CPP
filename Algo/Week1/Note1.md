### Algorithm

A set of well-defined rules/recipes to solve a computational problem.

### Why

=> Important for all branches of computer science

### Multiply Integer

Input: 2 n-digit number x and y
Output: product x * y

Algorithm number performed 1234*5678 is 4 numbers (1 and 2 and 3 and 4, we are couting the digits within the calculation number.)

The algorithm is going to be correct if it successfully delivered correct product from the primitive operation.

      5678
    x
      1234
    -------
     22712 => ≤ 2n operations
    17034-
   11356--
   5678---
  ----------
   7006652

Upshot: #operation overall ≤ constant * n^2 (like 4)

As an algorithm designer, you have to ask the question of can you do better?
