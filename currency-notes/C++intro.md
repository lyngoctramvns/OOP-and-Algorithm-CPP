## C++ intro

* C++ is a low level language

=> High level languages have more computing system underlying it compare to lower level languages.

## Run C++ program

g++ S-main.cpp --> produce assembler --> translate C++ to assembly language(lower level than c++)
g++ -c main.cpp --> produce object code
g++ main.cpp --> compile, assemble and link

* ls -l: list contents of current directory

* cd mydirector: move into a directory called mydirectory

* pwd: print out the present working directory

* g++ *.cpp -o myprogram: build all the cpp files in the current director and output an executable binary called myprogram

* ./myprogram: run a program called myprogram in the current directory
